# multicolor-line-follower
A color-based autonomous line follower robot using Arduino and GY-13 TCS3200 color sensor for intelligent path navigation in multi-color tracks.

An intelligent line-following robot designed to detect and follow colored paths using the TCS3200 color sensor and Arduino Uno. The bot can differentiate between multiple colors (e.g., red, green, blue, black) and follow them accordingly â€” suitable for educational automation tasks and smart navigation systems.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates a smart autonomous robot that can follow a line of a specific color. Unlike traditional black-line followers, this robot uses a GY-13 TCS3200 color sensor to distinguish between multiple colors on the track. It is controlled using an Arduino Uno and a motor driver module (L298N).

## Working Principle

1. The TCS3200 color sensor reads the color value beneath it.
2. Arduino compares the RGB values with predefined thresholds.
3. Based on the color detected (e.g., red = turn left, blue = turn right), the robot moves accordingly.
4. The robot follows the predefined color path intelligently.
